This repository demonstrates a common Haskell error: forgetting to specify a type signature for a function, leading to unexpected type errors or type inference issues.  The `bug.hs` file shows the incorrect code, while `bugSolution.hs` provides the corrected version with explicit type signatures.  This highlights the importance of type safety in Haskell and how specifying type signatures improves code clarity and helps the compiler catch errors early.
